## Latest repository preprint: the Version 1.0 human-function capacity system

### 18 core human functional capacities + 104 specific human functional capacities

The Version 1.0 capacity-system repository preprint makes the UOHF human-function capacity catalogue a public, citable scientific object. It defines **18 core capacities and 104 specific capacities**, each at the whole-person level and with traceable scientific or professional source support. It also publishes the catalogue-construction method, adjacent-capacity boundaries, version rule, and explicit public/non-public boundary.

- **[Publication overview](papers/capacity-system/README.md)**
- **[Complete English paper](papers/capacity-system/source/en/README.md)**
- **[中文完整论文](papers/capacity-system/source/zh/README.md)**
- Reserved Zenodo DOI: `10.5281/zenodo.21975100` — registration occurs when the Zenodo record is published
- License: **CC BY-NC 4.0**

The public catalogue is a versioned scientific coordinate set, not a claim of permanent exhaustiveness. “Specific capacity” is a public-reading umbrella term; the formal fine-grained ontology types remain `SUBCAPACITY` and `CAPACITY_COMPONENT` under their respective `CORE_CAPACITY`. The complete demand-to-capacity matrix, anatomical/physiological realization network, assessment/intervention mappings, person-specific reasoning rules, decision weights, production payloads, and real-user operational data are not released by this publication.

### The Human Function World Model

**Modeling the Whole Person Through Human Function Across Tasks, States, Actions, and Longitudinal Change**

This Version 1.0 preprint introduces the Human Function World Model (HFWM) as a whole-person framework for representing the same person across internal and external tasks, demand, required capacity, current capacity, actual functional engagement, evidence, governed action, and longitudinal state change. UOHF provides the human-function semantic foundation; HFWM adds explicit state, time, action, transition, feedback, and model-update structure while keeping human function as the organizing invariant.

### A Formal Framework for Human Function in UOHF

**Capacity, Functional Engagement, Demand-Bounded Realizability, and Evidence-Constrained Decision Support**

This Version 1.0 paper develops the formal mathematical and implementation-oriented core under UOHF Definition 2.1: typed formal objects, twelve axioms, demand-bounded realizability, result non-identifiability, evidence-bounded hypotheses, governed action selection, dynamic state update, falsification conditions, and a staged empirical research program.

### Unification in the Unified Ontology of Human Function

**A Whole-Person Conceptual Framework Centered on Human Function and Functional Engagement**

This focused paper explains what UOHF unifies, why functional engagement belongs inside the concept of human function, and how function, demand, bodily structure, bodily process, coordination, compensation, boundaries, state, time, and change are returned to the same whole person.

## What problem does UOHF solve?

Medicine, physiology, rehabilitation, exercise science, behavior, environment, and personal health records can all describe the same person, but they do not automatically form one shared computational object. UOHF establishes **human function** as that shared object and provides a governed semantic and rule foundation for asking:

- What internal or external task is present, and what demand does it generate?
- Which human functional capacities are required?
- Which of those capacities are currently available and within what boundary?
- How are those capacities actually engaged under the specified demand?
- What was observed, reported, measured, or inferred?
- What cost, burden, boundary, reserve, and recovery consequence are relevant?
- What state is supported by the current evidence?
- What governed action is admissible, and what changed afterward?

The objective is not to replace domain expertise. It is to make cross-domain human-function reasoning **computable, constrained, traceable, auditable, revisable, and longitudinally continuous**.

UOHF distinguishes the governed ontology and semantic-rule layer, the Human Function Engine, the Individual Human Function Model (IHFM), and the Human Function World Model (HFWM).

UOHF Definition 2.1 remains the current authoritative overall framework. Focused publications develop specific scientific layers under that framework and do not silently replace the root definition.

## Current implementation and claim boundary

The governed implementation supports concept domains, stable identifiers, typed relations, relation contracts, evidence structures, authority constraints, lifecycle governance, task-centered state convergence, action semantics, execution feedback, reassessment, and longitudinal monitoring.

This infrastructure-level statement does **not** mean that all 104 fine-grained Version 1.0 capacity objects already have complete production lifecycle activation, task/structure/assessment/intervention endpoint coverage, or Runtime release. Catalogue publication and production release are governed separately.

The complete production ontology, relation topology, implementation rules, and operational data assets are not reproduced in full in this public repository. UOHF does not currently claim completed BFO conformance, completed OWL axiomatization, universal physiological state classification, external expert consensus, clinical outcome validation, a completed molecular-to-person simulator, or autonomous diagnosis/treatment.

---

## Research and collaboration

Relevant collaboration areas include ontology engineering, whole-person and multiscale physiological modeling, human-function reference systems, rehabilitation and exercise science, longitudinal health-state modeling, auditable health AI, semantic interoperability, capacity measurement, and task-centered assessment/action/feedback systems.
